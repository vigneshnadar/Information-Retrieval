1) Extract inverted index from HW3
2) Calculate the weights for each term in each document
   The formula used for weight calculation is tf.idf
   where tf= term frequency of term in that document
         idf= (log (total number of documents)/(no of docs in which the term occurs))
   for the query term
   tf= term frequency of term in query
   idf is same as that of terms in corpus i.e. same as above idf
3) Once the weights are calculated
   The Cosine similarity score for each document is calcuated
4) Documents are sorted as per their score
   and top 100 docs are written to a file in a particular format
