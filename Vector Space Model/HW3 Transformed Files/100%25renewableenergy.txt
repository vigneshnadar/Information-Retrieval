tidal power wave power wind power topics by country 100% renewable energy marketing and policy trends v t e the shepherds flat wind farm is an 845 megawatt mw wind farm in the us state of oregon  the 550 mw desert sunlight solar farm in california the 392 mw ivanpah solar power facility in california the facility\s three towers construction of the salt tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage 1 so that output can be provided after the sun goes down and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements 2 the 280 mw solana generating station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year 3 global public support for different energy sources 2011 based on a poll by ipsos global @dvisor 4 the incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity heating and cooling and transport is motivated by global warming  pollution and other ecological as well as economic and energy security concerns shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system  in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated 5 in 2014 renewables such as wind  geothermal  solar  biomass and burnt waste provided 19% of the total world final energy consumption roughly half of it traditional use of biomass 6 the most important sector electricity with a renewable share of 22.8%, most of it coming from water power with a share of 16.6%, followed by wind with 3.1%. 6 several places run their grids almost exclusively on renewable energy at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of \u201c climate stabilization wedges \u201d that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change  and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges 7 mark z jacobson  professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program says producing all new energy with wind power  solar power  and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic jacobson says that energy costs today with a wind solar water system should be similar to today\s energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies 8 the main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will 9 similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that \u201csufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security  and the escalation of energy costs \u2026 renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand 10 the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political rather than technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial  the fossil fuels lobby  political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints 11 contents 1 history 2 recent developments 3 places with around 100% renewable electricity 4 obstacles 5 see also 6 references 7 external links 8 further reading history  edit  using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a science paper 12 published in 1975 by danish physicist bent s\xf8rensen  which was followed by several other proposals 13 in 1976 energy policy analyst amory lovins coined the term  soft energy path  to describe an alternative future where energy efficiency and appropriate renewable energy sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels 14 in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published these were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa in the same year danish energy professor henrik lund published a first paper 15 in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100% renewable energy in denmark since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy after 2009 publications began to rise steeply covering 100% scenarios for countries in europa america australia and other parts of the world 13 even in the early 2000s it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity however renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then 16 solar photovoltaic modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation on-shore wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions concentrated solar thermal power cst with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent 16 renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated 5 wind turbines generate 39 17 percent of danish electricity and denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well together wind and biomass provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country\s six million inhabitants in 2010, portugal\u2019s 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources spain\u2019s 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables 5 renewable energy has a history of strong public support in america for example a 2013 gallup survey showed that two in three americans want the us to increase domestic energy production using solar power 76%, wind power 71%, and natural gas 65%. far fewer want more petroleum production 46% and more nuclear power 37%. least favored is coal with about one in three americans favouring it 18 ren21 says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a binding 20% by 2020 target for the european union some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables outside europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020\u20132030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%. 19 nuclear power involves substantial accident risks eg fukushima nuclear disaster  chernobyl disaster  and the unsolved problem of safe long-term high-level radioactive waste management  and carbon capture and storage has rather limited safe storage potentials 13 these constraints have also led to an interest in 100% renewable energy a well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade evaluating scenarios for 100% renewable energy for various geographical areas in recent years more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources 20 the incentive to use 100% renewable energy is created by global warming and ecological as well as economic concerns post peak oil  the first country to propose 100% renewable energy was iceland  in 1998. 21 proposals have been made for japan in 2003, 22 and for australia in 2011. 23 albania iceland and paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources albania and paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal 24 norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources 97 percent from hydropower 25 iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity the road map for the united states 26 27 commitment by denmark 28 and vision 2050 for europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100% renewable energy 29 later reduced to 2040 in 2011. 30 zero carbon britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy 31 in 2015, hawaii enacted a law that the renewable portfolio standard shall be 100 percent by 2045. this is often confused with renewable energy if electricity produced on the grid is 65 gwh from fossil fuel and 35 gwh from renewable energy and rooftop solar produces 80 gwh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 gwh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 gwh then the rps is 115 percent 32 it is estimated that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy 33 research that has been published in energy policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable but requires political support it would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldn\t utilize bioenergy  other changes involve use of electric cars and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage 34 35 recent developments  edit  the fourth revolution energy is a german documentary film released in 2010. it shows the vision of a global society which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100% with renewable energies showing a complete reconstruction of the economy to reach this goal in 2011, hermann scheer wrote the book the energy imperative 100 percent renewable now  published by routledge reinventing fire is a book by amory lovins released in october 2011. by combining reduced energy use with energy efficiency gains lovins says that there will be a $5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy this can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies through market forces led by business 36 bill clinton says the book is a wise detailed and comprehensive blueprint 37 the first paragraph of the preface says imagine fuel without fear no climate change no oil spills dead coal miners dirty air devastated lands lost wildlife no energy poverty no oil-fed wars tyrannies or terrorists nothing to run out nothing to cut off nothing to worry about just energy abundance benign and affordable for all for ever 38 the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand in a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050 the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. 39 in 2011, the international energy agency has said that solar energy technologies in its many forms can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces 40 the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries\u2019 energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared 40 in 2011, the refereed journal energy policy published two articles by mark z jacobson  a professor of engineering at stanford university  and research scientist mark a delucchi about changing our energy supply mix and providing all global energy with wind water and solar power the articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power transportation and heating/cooling from wind water and sunlight wws which are safe clean options in part i jacobson and delucchi discuss wws energy system characteristics aspects of energy demand wws resource availability wws devices needed and material requirements 41 they estimate that 3,800,000 5 mw wind turbines  5350 100 mw geothermal power plants and 270 new 1300 mw hydroelectric power plants will be required in terms of solar power  an additional 49,000 300 mw concentrating solar plants 40,000 300 mw solar photovoltaic power plants and 1.7 billion 3\xa0kw rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed such an extensive wws infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30%. 41 in part ii jacobson and delucchi address variability of supply system economics and energy policy initiatives associated with a wws system the authors advocate producing all new energy with wws by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050. barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic energy costs with a wws system should be similar to today\s energy costs 8 in general jacobson has said wind water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world\s energy eliminating all fossil fuels  42 he advocates a smart mix of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps 43 a 2012 study by the university of delaware for a 72 gw system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective for the pjm interconnection  would use 17 gw of solar 68 gw of offshore wind  and 115 gw of onshore wind although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources 44 in march 2012, denmark\s parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity heat and fuels from renewables by 2050. 45 irenec is an annual conference on 100% renewable energy started in 2011 by eurosolar turkey the 2013 conference was in istanbul 46 47 more recently jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind water and sunlight for new york 48 california 49 and washington 50 states by 2050. as of 2014, a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states the 50-state plan is part of the solutions project  an independent outreach effort led by jacobson actor mark ruffalo  and film director josh fox  51 as of 2014, many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind solar biomass biofuel hydro ocean and geothermal energy debate over detailed plans remain but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable economically feasible socially viable and so realisable this prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by germany one of the world\s most successful industrial economies to undertake a major energy transition  energiewende  52 in 2015 a study was published in energy and environmental science that describes a pathway to 100% renewable energy in the united states by 2050 without using biomass implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable as by 2050 it would save about $600 billion dollars health costs a year due to reduced air pollution and $3.3 trillion global warming costs this would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around $8300 compared to a business as usual pathway according to that study barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political as most people didn\t know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs 53 places with around 100% renewable electricity  edit  the following places meet around 100%, or

sector in denmark  as of 2014, is 40% wind power with plans in place to reach 85%. the electricity sector in canada and the electricity sector in new zealand have even higher percentages 65% and 75% respectively and austria is approaching 70%. 75 as of 2015, the electricity sector in germany sometimes meets almost 100% of the electricity demand with pv and wind power and renewable electricity is over 25%. 76 77 albania has 94.8% of installed capacity as hydroelectric 5.2% diesel generator but albania imports 39% of its electricity 78 79 in 2016, portugal achieved 100% renewable electricity for four days between 7 may and 11 may partly because efficient energy use had reduced electricity demand 80 france and sweden have low carbon intensity since they predominately use a mixture of nuclear power and hydroelectricity although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification 81 82 for example electric cars achieve much better miles per gallon equivalent than fossil fuel cars and another example is renewable heat such as in the case of denmark which is proposing to move to greater use of heat pumps for heating buildings which provide multiple kilowatts of heat per kilowatt of electricity obstacles  edit  the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies at the pace required to prevent runaway climate change  are primarily political and not technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are 11 climate change denial efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry political paralysis unsustainable consumption of energy and resources path dependencies and outdated infrastructure financial and governance constraints nasa climate scientist james hansen discusses the problem with rapid phase out of fossil fuels and said that while it is conceivable in places such as new zealand and norway suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the united states china india or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the easter bunny and tooth fairy  83 84 in 2013, smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of jacobson and colleagues and writing in an issue of spectrum prepared by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  he identified numerous points of concern such as cost intermittent power supply growing nimbyism  and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that history and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed 83 85 smil and hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power but many other scientists and engineers have analysed this situation and said that the electricity grid can cope 86  citation needed  lester r brown founder and president of the earth policy institute  a nonprofit research organization based in washington dc says a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy is both possible and necessary brown compares with the us entry into world war ii and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the us industry and economy a quick transition to 100% renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by brown to follow an approach with similar urgency 87 the international energy agency says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production 88 the issue of intermittent supply applies to popular renewable technologies mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics  and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system as well as the demand side flexibility variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when dispatchable generation is also available but at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification 88 renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 89 in 2011, the intergovernmental panel on climate change  the world\s leading climate researchers selected by the united nations said as infrastructure and energy systems develop in spite of the complexities there are few if any fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied 39 ipcc scenarios generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world 90 the ipcc said that if governments were supportive and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world\s energy use within forty years 91 rajendra pachauri  chairman of the ipcc said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global gdp annually this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible 91 in november 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change came out with their fifth report  saying that in the absence of any one technology such as bioenergy carbon dioxide capture and storage nuclear wind and solar climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent for example it may cost 40% more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture table 3.2 92 see also  edit  renewable energy portal catching the sun film energy transition energy
