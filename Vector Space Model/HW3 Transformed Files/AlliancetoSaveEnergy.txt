forms of incandescent light bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient lights such as cfl halogen incandescents and led lights the purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents however the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower life-cycle costs than their legacy incandescent counterparts

incandescent light bulbs that will be phased out of production following passage of the clean energy bill of 2007. carboncount  edit  carboncount is a metric developed by the alliance to save energy that quantifies the impact of investments in us.-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide co 2  emissions resulting from each $1,000 of investment 7 in 2015, bloomberg new energy finance honored carboncount with its finance for resilience fire award 8 fire is an open and action-oriented platform that collects develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy climate sustainability and green growth fire singles out ideas that have the potential for incremental finance of at least $1bn in clean
