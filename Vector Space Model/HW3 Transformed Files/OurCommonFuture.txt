development wced was published in 1987. its targets were multilateralism and interdependence of nations in the search for a sustainable development path the report sought to recapture the spirit of the stockholm conference - which had introduced environmental concerns to the formal political development sphere our common future placed environmental issues firmly on the political agenda it aimed to discuss the environment and development as one single issue the document was the culmination of a \u201c900-day\u201d international-exercise which catalogued analysed and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from \u201csenior government representatives scientists and experts research institutes industrialists representatives of non-governmental organizations and the general public\u201d held at public hearings throughout the world the brundtland commission\s mandate was to 1 \u201c re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative concrete and realistic action proposals to deal with them strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and to assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change and raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals voluntary organizations businesses institutes and governments\u201d 1987 347. \u201cthe commission focused its attention in the areas of population food security the loss of species and genetic resources energy industry and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another\u201d the brundtland commission report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction gender equity and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed as such the report offered \u201cthe analysis the broad remedies and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development\u201d within such societies 1987 16. however the report was unable to identify the modes of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth the report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development 2 the publication of our common future and the work of the world commission on environment and development laid the groundwork for the convening of the 1992 earth summit and the adoption of agenda 21  the rio declaration and to the establishment of the commission on sustainable development  an oft-quoted definition of sustainable development is defined in the report as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in addition key contributions of our common future to the concept of sustainable development include the recognition that the many crises facing the planet are interlocking crises that are elements of a single crisis of the whole 3 and of the vital need for the active participation of all sectors of society in consultation and decisions relating to sustainable development our common future is also known as the brundtland report
