Query= "global warming potential"
STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS:
Inorder to compare the top 5 results below is an analysis of each term
Document Name and Term frequency in that document,IDF and Term Weight (TF * IDF)

1. Comparison
At the end of the doc STATISTICS for TOP 5 Documents in each search engine is displayed
in both CCSR and LR GlobalWarming is the highest ranked document. This is due to the presence of
both terms global and warming in high frequencies in that document.
Similarly 'Negativecarbondioxideemission' and 'Carbondioxideemissions' get high scores in both CSSR and LR
due to the above reasons.
Similar logic applies to the other docs in CSSR like 'Climatechangemitigation' and 'Climatechange'.
The score is very dependent on the term weights of terms in the query for CSSR.

The understanding of the scoring mechanism of Lucene is posted in 'Lucene Scoring Mechanism.txt'
The summary is as follows
* Documents containing *all* the search terms are good
* Matches on rare words are better than for common words
* Long documents are not as good as short ones
* Documents which mention the search terms many times are good

Due to the above mentioned reasons 'JosephRomm' and 'Personalcarbontrading'
end up in the top 5 of Lucene results even query terms do not have high weights in these documents


Due to the absence of Boolean model of Information Retrieval
query boost and other length normalization from CCSR, the order of results between CSSR and LR
is slight varied. Though the core logic of ranking is similar to an extent. Hence 'GlobalWarming','Carbondioxideemissions'
and 'Negativecarbondioxideemission' feature in the top 5 of both the scoring mechanisms.
