1. Comparison on top 5 links  and number of URLS crawled between BFS and DFS
DFS
Depth: 1, Rank: 1, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy             (Seed Url)
Depth: 2, Rank: 2, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design  (outlink from seed url)
Depth: 3, Rank: 3, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy                   (outlink from url at Depth 2)
Depth: 4, Rank: 4, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Energy_(journal)         (outlink from url at Depth 3)
Depth: 5, Rank: 5, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating                  (outlink from url at Depth 4)

BFS
Depth: 1, Rank: 1, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy  (Seed Url)
----All the below Urls are child links of Seed Url
Depth: 2, Rank: 2, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design
Depth: 2, Rank: 3, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy
Depth: 2, Rank: 4, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating
Depth: 2, Rank: 5, URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_photovoltaics

BFS Crawled 1000 links
DFS Crawled 678 links
The number of links in DFS is less than BFS because in DFS
top 5 links consist of 1 link from Depth 1, 1 link from Depth 2 ,
1 link from Depth 3, 1 link from Depth 4 and 1 link from Depth 5
When we reach Depth 5 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating) since we have reached maximum depth
the url is marked as crawled
But we do not gather the links in the page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating).
Suppose while backtracking in DFS the above url is found again
at Depth 3 or any other Depth , since the url is marked as crawled
all the urls in the page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating) are missed out. Hence less links crawled

BFS takes seed url and gather all links in seed url and adds them to queue
The above process is repeated with remaining items of queue
So even if a crawled link appears again at another depth, we already have gathered all links in the page
So we do not miss out on any urls
Due to this DFS has fewer links than BFS.
