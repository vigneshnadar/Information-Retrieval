The Stop List was created from the unigram data

The stopword list consists of frequently used words in English language like 'the','is','an'
It can also contain countires, cities, name , adjectives, temporal words like
'wednesday', 'yesterday', 'tommorow'
These terms occur in high frequencies across many documents in the corpus
Hence tf-idf can be to generate the stopword list.
Other factors also need to be considered at the same time.
Generating a stop word list based on tf-idf alone is not entirely accurate


The cut off value is chosen as top 41
Since proper terms with high frequencies like 'power', 'gas'
but which should not be included in the stoplist started appearing after 41


Few terms like 'water','united','power','energy' were manually removed from the stoplist
since they are important and should not be included in stoplist
